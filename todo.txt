BUGS
    you can appear to build one more building than what you can afford. - because of how I programmed it.
    i don't think it's checking when you click to see if its too much

    when you game over - it doesn't disable the buttons - possibly an issue with refresh overriding it.

    i clicked on the specific location or a rough area to place shoring and it placed it, way extended far away than what it should.
        happens horizontally and I think either way but I just had it happen building left to right ad it went off screen
TODO
    make undo an actual upgrade - have the player pay $50 to be able to do a line of undoing (once they start to move after pressing undo, it's considered a new undo but they acn do multiple undos as long as its consecutive)

    when the tile that shoring is sitting on moves, that should destroy the shoring.

    try to see what it looks like when a ladder can only be build from the bottom of a shaft to the top of a shaft - not partial builds

    when you fall and get hurt, flash the border of that cell red and do red delta for moves to let the player know

    scale the upkeep cost of buildings so that instead of just +1 - its +1 per every ten levels it goes down. So a ladder within 1-10 deep is 1 but 11-20 is 2.
