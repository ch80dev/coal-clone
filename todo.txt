BUGS
    you can appear to build one more building than what you can afford. - because of how I programmed it.
    i don't think it's checking when you click to see if its too much

    when you game over - it doesn't disable the buttons - possibly an issue with refresh overriding it.
TODO
    make undo an actual upgrade - have the player pay $50 to be able to do a line of undoing (once they start to move after pressing undo, it's considered a new undo but they acn do multiple undos as long as its consecutive)
