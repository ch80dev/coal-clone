BUGS
    1x9 not highlighting correctly

TODO
    make undo an actual upgrade - have the player pay $50 to be able to do a line of undoing (once they start to move after pressing undo, it's considered a new undo but they acn do multiple undos as long as its consecutive)



    redo build code now that I made build sections in stead of the stupid way of horizontal, vertical, etc


    Players should be able to keep going down to try to earn more money. If I add this, maybe add oil. (so players have to setup pipes to pipe it back out of the map.)



    use numbers to select items in buy menu

    shoring only falls if there's not a shoring to the left and right of it. shoring should also keep you from falling.
