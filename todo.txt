BUGS
    1x9 not highlighting correctly
    1x9 not building properly - only placed one where I clicked
TODO
    make undo an actual upgrade - have the player pay $50 to be able to do a line of undoing (once they start to move after pressing undo, it's considered a new undo but they acn do multiple undos as long as its consecutive)

    redo build code now that I made build sections in stead of the stupid way of horizontal, vertical, etc

    Players should be able to keep going down to try to earn more money. If I add this, maybe add oil. (so players have to setup pipes to pipe it back out of the map.)



    stop being able to place ladders on the roof


    make player highlighted

    maybe be able to take back buildings
    highlight empty spaces that are about to be covered up
